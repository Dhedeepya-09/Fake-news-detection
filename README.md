📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

🚀 A Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project to Classify News as REAL or FAKE

📌 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter, misinformation spreads faster than ever.

This project builds an Automated Fake News Detection System using:

🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🔹 TF-IDF Vectorization

🔹 Passive Aggressive Classifier

🔹 Supervised Machine Learning

The model predicts whether a news article is:

✅ REAL

❌ FAKE

❗ Problem Statement

Fake news can:

Manipulate public opinion

Influence elections

Spread panic

Damage institutional credibility

Manual verification is inefficient.
Hence, an intelligent ML-based detection system is required.

⚙️ Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Load dataset

Handle missing values

Split into training & testing sets

2️⃣ Text Vectorization – TF-IDF

TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency):

Converts text into numerical format

Assigns importance to meaningful words

Reduces impact of common words

3️⃣ Model Used – Passive Aggressive Classifier

🚀 Why This Model?

Fast and efficient

Suitable for large-scale text classification

Updates weights only when misclassification occurs

Performs well for binary classification

4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation

📊 80% Training Data

📊 20% Testing Data

📈 Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

📊 Model Performance
Metric	Performance
Accuracy	~90%+
Precision	High
Recall	High
F1-Score	Balanced

⚠ Results may vary slightly per execution.
